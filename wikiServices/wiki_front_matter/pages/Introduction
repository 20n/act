This site presents a list of chemicals that can be produced by biosynthesis, biochemical pathways to each chemical, and the protein sequences of the encoding enzymes. It includes both natural pathways and those that can result by combining genes from disparate organisms. Currently, we include the reactions of monofunctional enzymes which are sufficient to describe pathways for lipids, terpenoids, flavonoids, aromatics, and oligosaccharides.  It mostly excludes polymeric metabolites such as polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, and polysaccharides.

== Modeling ==
A standardized Ontology was initially populated by merging multiple biochemical data sources including BRENDA, MetaCyc, and KEGG. The ontology describes Reaction and Chemical entities. Using data cleaning algorithms, we identify Reactions that are not mechanistically plausible and common, and flag them as such.  Using pathway synthesis algorithms, we compute the hypergraph of transformations that result by applying all Reactions on a seed of supplied chemicals.  As presented, the seed is glucose, ATP, and common salts. From this, we obtain a set of metabolites that have at least one contiguous biochemical pathway from glucose and are directly implied by observed data traceable to a cited reference. This set of metabolites is referred to as the L2 space. Note that L2 is not restricted to naturally occurring molecules; it considers all possible ways of mixing and matching enzymes from disparate organisms.  It is, however, restricted to known molecules because all L2 have been described in some cited reference.

Using the bag of Reactions, we also automatically compute reaction operators. These are chemoinformatic models that describe a subset of the atoms participating in a reaction and their atom-to-atom mapping between substrate(s) and product(s). The specific abstraction we consider, an hchERO, corresponds to the atoms whose bonding is directly affected by the reaction and the surrounding atoms that share molecular orbitals with those atoms.  It represents those atoms that are mechanistically involved in the orbital transformations occurring during a reaction. Currently, we only consider operators that have been observed in at least two reactions and thus exclude rare reaction mechanisms that may nonetheless be mechanistically valid.  In total, there are currently 467 such hchEROs.  The operators can be computationally projected on a molecule to predict the structure of the chemical product that would result. We apply the full collection of hchEROs on each L2 molecule to obtain a space termed L4.  We can exhaustively construct L4 for 2 iterations.  The resulting L4n2 space represents the set of molecules that can be biosynthesized with any number of known reactions and at most 2 speculated reactions.  An L4 projected reaction should be interpreted as mechanistically plausible, but an enzyme capable of performing the reaction may not be known. In such cases, an enzyme could be identified by screening natural diversity or engineering an enzyme with a similar mechanism.

We also consider two additional spaces (L3 and L4-NRO) which seek to further restrict the speculation of plausible reactions by consideration of substrate specificity. We employ a structure-activity relationship model (SAR) to describe the shape of a substrate participating in a reaction. The combination of an hchERO and an SAR model describes the range of expected substrates for an enzyme and its products.  When all such models are projected on L2, we obtain a subset of L4 called L3.  Like an L2 prediction, an L3 prediction maps to a specific enzyme and protein sequence. Thus an L3 prediction does not necessarily require identification of new enzymes.  An L4-NRO prediction is another subset of L4 that satisfies a “Natural Reaction Operator”, or NRO, in addition to the hchERO.  Like the models used in L3, an NRO consists of an hchERO and a SAR model.  The difference is that L3 models consider each enzyme individually whereas an NRO model considers the aggregate SAR models of all known enzymes of the same hchERO.  The resulting space, L4-NRO, corresponds to the expected diversity of molecules that could exist using natural enzymes, but would still require mining to identify.
