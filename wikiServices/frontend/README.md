== Substructure Search Frontend ==

Note: this is still a major work in progress.


This package represents a minimal interface to the substructure search web service.  You can set up a test instance
by running
```
npm start
```
and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.  A complete build process with all assets included is still in progress.

Use
```
npm run build
```
to do a full production build.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
