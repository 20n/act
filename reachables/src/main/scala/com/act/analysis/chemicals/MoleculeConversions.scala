    The effects are:
      Longer and more patterns hold more information on the molecule.

      Due to the higher number of patterns to be explored, structure import will be slower.

      Increases the number of patterns considered. As a result of that, the fingerprint darkness rises (up to a limit).
      The number of bit collisions increase.

      While the number of bit collisions is not too high,
      the stored information increases, which is beneficial for the efficiency of screening.
