        Validation data: Same as above, but are not used in training.
        These are used by the callbacks to stop the network from overtraining.

        Batch_size: How many samples should be evaluated at one time.  This means that if we have many samples,
        we can train the network and calculate the gradients multiple times per iteration, increasing our convergence
        speed.  For example, if I had 10 samples and set batch_size to 2,
        it would calculate the gradient (Modify the weights) 5 times, one for each batch on each iteration.

        Nb_epoch: How many epochs to train for.  We just set this to a really high number
        and expect the callback to terminate prior.

        Shuffle: If to shuffle the data when training.  Pretty self-explanatory.

            Early Stopping: This stops the model given that certain preconditions are met.  We look at the validation
                            loss value and stop the model from training once the validation loss stops significantly
