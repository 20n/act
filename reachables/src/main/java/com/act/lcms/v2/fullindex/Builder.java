     * conversion of those values into byte arrays that RocksDB can consume.  If you haven't already, go read this
     * tutorial on ByteBuffers: http://mindprod.com/jgloss/bytebuffer.html
     *
     * ByteBuffers are quite low-level structures, and they use some terms you need to watch out for:
     *   capacity: The total number of bytes in the array backing the buffer.  Don't write more than this.
     *   position: The next index in the buffer to read or write a byte.  Moves with each read or write op.
     *   limit:    A mark of where the final byte in the buffer was written.  Don't read past this.
     *             The remaining() call is affected by the limit.
     *   mark:     Ignore this for now, we don't use it.  (We'll always, always read buffers from 0.)
     *
     * And here are some methods that we'll use often:
     *   clear:     Set position = 0, limit = 0.  Pretend the buffer is empty, and is ready for more writes.
     *   flip:      Set limit = position, then position = 0.  This remembers how many bytes were written to the buffer
     *              (as the current position), and then puts the position at the beginning.
     *              Always call this after the write before a read.
     *   rewind:    Set position = 0.  Buffer is ready for reading, but unless the limit was set we might now know how
     *              many bytes there are to read.  Always call flip() before rewind().  Can rewind many times to re-read
     *              the buffer repeatedly.
     *   remaining: How many bytes do we have left to read?  Requires an accurate limit value to avoid garbage bytes.
     *   reset:     Don't use this.  It uses the mark, which we don't need currently.
     *
     * Write/read patterns look like:
     *   buffer.clear(); // Clear out anything already in the buffer.
     *   buffer.put(thing1).put(thing2)... // write a bunch of stuff
     *   buffer.flip(); // Prep for reading.  Call *once*!
     *
     *   while (buffer.hasRemaining()) { buffer.get(); } // Read a bunch of stuff.
     *   buffer.rewind(); // Ready for reading again!
     *   while (buffer.hasRemaining()) { buffer.get(); } // Etc.
     *   buffer.reset(); // Forget what was written previously, buffer is ready for reuse.
     *
     * We use byte buffers because they're fast, efficient, and offer incredibly convenient means of serializing a
     * stream of primitive types to their minimal binary representations.  The same operations on objects + object
     * streams require significantly more CPU cycles, consume more memory, and tend to be brittle (i.e. if a class
     * definition changes slightly, serialization may break).  Since the data we're dealing with is pretty simple, we
     * opt for the low-level approach.
