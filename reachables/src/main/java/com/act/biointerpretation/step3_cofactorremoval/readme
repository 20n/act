This step creates the database jarvis from synapse.

It removes both concrete cofactors (ie, ones with precise inchis) as well as abstract ones
(ie, FAKE inchis).  It sequentially removes the cofactors in a prioritized manner until only
one substrate and product remain.

Uniqueness in this database is the matching of:
1. the remaining substrate
2. the remaining product
3. the names of the substrate cofactors
4. the names of the product cofactors
