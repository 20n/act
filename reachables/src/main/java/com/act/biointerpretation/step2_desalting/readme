*  Desalting is the process of standardizing ionized variants of a Molecule.  The algorithm
   is Desalter, the cleaning algorithm that modifies the database is ReactionDesalter

*  It also splits multi-component reactions into multiple entities

*  It pulls data from drknow and writes to synapse

*  Desalter currently uses Indigo for RO Projection, and this needs to
   be replaced with ChemAxon

ReactionDesalter has been tested in various ways.  First off, it is
broken into two big classes:  ReactionDesalter itself does the
processing of the database using an instance of Desalter.  Desalter
does all the business logic of inputting an inchi and outputting one
or more desalted versions of it (the "clean" method).  Though it does
a little more than apply ROs, the most essential piece of the code is
the ROs, which are stored in a file desalting_ros.txt.  It needs to go in a
"/data" folder on the file path.

This file is available on Dropbox at: /Dropbox\ \(20n\)/20n\ Team\ Folder/act_data/cofactor_data.txt

That RO file also includes tests.  Running Desalter.main()
directly will execute these tests.  They all pass.

There is a second file (desalter_constants) that are additional tests,
but I don't know if they are being used by the code right now or not.

That main method will also pull 10000 entries from the database and bin
each one based on the result:
(caused an error, got modified, didn't get modified, was split into
multiple inchis).  I've gone through these lists somewhat and for the
most part found no errors.  There are some edge cases (specifically
porphyrins and some rare ions like C[N-]) that are not handled
currently.  I have also performed this analysis on 10000 entries that
are not necessarily in Reactions, and those looked fine too. After
running ReactionDesalter on Dr. Know and creating synapse, I examined
1000 reaction entires from synapse.  I looked at all the instances of
"+" in the SMILES and found no errors.  I also inspected the first 200
in detail to confirm that no chemicals were lost relative to the text
description.
