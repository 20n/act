/**
 * This class is used to filter the potential substrates of an enzyme based on their number of carbons.
 * This should generally not be used alone, but as an extra filter on top of a substructure based SAR.
 *
 * This is useful primarily to avoid matching very large, complicated molecules, to SARs for which all
 * of our evidence points to relatively small substrates. For example, if a substructure SAR was constructed on 5
 * substrates, with Carbon counts between 10 and 20, we wouldn't necessarily want to assume that the corresponding
 * enzyme would also act on a molecule with 100 Carbon atoms, even if that molecule matched the substructure SAR.
