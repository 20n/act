This package is for validating reactions.  It builds off the files generated in the cofactor and operator packages. It
is for use in evaluating whether a particular set of substrates and products represent a valid enzymatic reaction.  It
also is for scanning the database, applying this filter, and outputing lists of valid and invalid data.  It has the
following components:

>  MechanisticCleaner -- Scans through the jarvis db applying MechanisticValidator and writing to database viki.
In viki, it labels reactions with EROs, and (in the future) balances and otherwise fixes misstated reactions
*  Throws up a ReactionDashboard GUI when a rxn has score -1 (ie, didn't error out but no ROs applied)
*  This is mostly working, but hasn't been extensively run/curated

> MechanisticValidator -- inputs a reaction and says whether it is valid, invalid, or unknown (null)
*  uses the 2nd-generation cofactors curated during operator curation, and includes the originals too
*  Also uses FakeCofactorFinder to identify FAKE inchis that are cofactors
*  the cofactor data is a curated list now, and will continue to be updated
*  It uses all the hcERO operators generated in the operator package
*  The ros similarly are now a curated list, and will continue to be updated
*  I feel comfortable with the logic within this class
*  Returns a Report object with a log of what occurred, and a score for the validation and the RO that produced that score
*  The Report.score is an int with -9999 for an error, -1 for no match, 0 for match to a bad rxn, and 1-5 for varying degrees of confirmation
*  so, score > 0 implies valid data

>  ValidationAnalyzer -- inputs the results of running main of MechanisticValidator
*  Running the main method of MechanisticValidator over a 4 days gets through 478805 reactions.
*  Running ValidationAnalyzer on its output gives score counts (number of reactions with this score):

-1	57608  //No Exceptions, but no RO satisfied
0	50     //An RO worked, but it was an invalidated RO
3	3823   //An RO worked
4	57173  //A high-quality RO worked
-9003	350154  //Failed due to a FAKE, non-cofactor inchi
-9004	2387    //Error simplifying inchis to remove chirality
-9999	7604    //Failed somewhere early -- no new code appears
-99999	6       //Manually aborted due to stall

*  ValidationAnalyzer from the same run gives the following counts of 115 ROs (names added in excel):

*  Note that not all RO's are needed to explain 50% of the data, only 115
*  Note that they aren't exactly the first 115
*  Note that 50% of reactions that don't error out are not satisfied by an RO
*  Note that 73% of reactions fall out due to non-cofactor FAKE inchis


>  OperatorEditor -- GUI inputs an RO and scans DB for matching reactions
*  works and run a few times
*  will work better (be more responsive) when run over a list of reactions that have already
   passed through MechanisticValidator
*  Need to run this on the top ~150 ROs and confirm that all their hits are legit, and thereby it becomes a '5'
