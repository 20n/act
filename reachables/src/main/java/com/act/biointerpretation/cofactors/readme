*  The cofactor package was a sidebar project to pull out a mostly-complete list of cofactor inchis

*  Mostly the classes in here are for constructing a GUI:

    CofactorGUI:  the JFrame container for the GUI
    CofactorGUIHelper:  the launcher and controller of the GUI
    CofactorPanel:  the left-and-right lists of cofactor names
    ControlPanel:  the buttons in the GUI
    MolViewer:  a JPanel that shows a BufferedImage (of a Molecule or Reaction)
    ReactantsPanel:  the smiles, inchi, name, id fields at the top of the GUI

*  Two of them describe datastructures to be used outside this package:

    SimpleReaction:  The representation of a Reaction as two Molecules (for substrate and product)
                     and two Sets of String to represent the cofactors

    ChemicalInfo:    id, name, inchi, smiles for a Chemical

*  SimpleReactionFactory:  the factory class for generating SimpleReaction instances
                           It inputs a Reaction object and outputs a SimpleReaction
                           It has a database connection because it must pull Chemicals
                           from their ID's.

*  I think everything in this package runs without a ChemAxon license, but it does use ChemAxon
