This package is for validating reactions.  It builds off the files generated in the cofactor and operator packages. It
is for use in evaluating whether a particular set of substrates and products represent a valid enzymatic reaction.  It
also is for scanning the database, applying this filter, and outputing lists of valid and invalid data.  It has the
following components:

> MechanisticValidator -- inputs a reaction and says whether it is valid, invalid, or unknown (null)
*  uses the 2nd-generation cofactors curated during operator curation, and includes the originals too
*  Also uses FakeCofactorFinder to identify FAKE inchis that are cofactors
*  the cofactor data is a curated list now, and will continue to be updated
*  It uses all the hcERO operators generated in the operator package
*  The ros similarly are now a curated list, and will continue to be updated
*  I feel comfortable with the logic within this class
*  Returns a Report object with a log of what occurred, and a score for the validation and the RO that produced that score
*  The Report.score is an int with -9999 for an error, -1 for no match, 0 for match to a bad rxn, and 1-5 for varying degrees of confirmation
*  so, score > 0 implies valid data

>  MechanisticCleaner -- Scans through the synapse db applying MechanisticValidator
*  Throws up a ReactionDashboard GUI when a rxn has score -1 (ie, didn't error out but no ROs applied)

TODO:  fix the keeping track of curated rxns

*  OperatorEditor -- GUI inputs an RO and scans DB for matching reactions

*  Run over metacyc
