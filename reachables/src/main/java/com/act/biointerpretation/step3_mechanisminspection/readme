This package is for validating reactions.  It builds off the files generated in the cofactor and operator packages. It
is for use in evaluating whether a particular set of substrates and products represent a valid enzymatic reaction.  It
also is for scanning the database, applying this filter, and outputing lists of valid and invalid data.  It has the
following components:

> MechanisticValidator -- inputs a reaction and says whether it is valid, invalid, or unknown (null)
*  uses the 2nd-generation cofactors curated during operator curation, and includes the originals too
*  the cofactor data is a curated list now, and will continue to be updated
*  It uses all the hcERO operators generated in the operator package
*  The ros similarly are now a curated list, and will continue to be updated
*  I feel comfortable with the logic within this class
*  It works successfully on the propanol>>propanal example tested by the main(...) method

*  OperatorEditor -- GUI inputs an RO and scans DB for matching reactions

*  Run over metacyc
*  MechanisticCleaner -- uses the MechanisticValidator to clean the DB and curate with GUI
