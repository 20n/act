Ultimately we decided that stereochemical abstraction should happen during the initiation
phase of the synthesis algorithm.

SplitChem, SplitReaction, and SplitProjection are the interesting parts of this. They
are described elsewhere.

I think the other stuff in here is likely garbage.

ReactionStereoFixer is a stub for a cleaner algorithm for database modification. It currently
does nothing useful.

StereoAbstracter is a helper class for ReactionStereoFixer (was meant to be Desalter's counterpart
but then aborted upon decision to move this to synthesis.
