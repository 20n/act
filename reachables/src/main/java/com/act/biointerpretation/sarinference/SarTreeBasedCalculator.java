/**
 * Calculates a SARs hit percentage score by seeing which of the leaves of its subtree are LCMS hits,
 * and which are LCMS misses. This is not a perfect scoring across an entire prediction corpus; it is essentially
 * a much faster, heuristic approach to simulating what SarHitPercentageCalculator does.  The key assumption here is
 * that we don't have to look outside a given SAR's subtree when we're trying to assign it a score, since there is
 * probably almost nothing outside its subtree (in the clustering hierarchy) which will match it anyway.  However,
 * as LibMCS clustering is not always perfect, there may in fact be molecules that match a SAR, which do not get
 * clustered under that SAR's subtree.  In such cases, this heuristic score diverges from the full score calculated
 * across the entire corpus.
