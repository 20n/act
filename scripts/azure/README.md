# Azure Utilities

This collection of scripts and config files can be used to automate the setup of azure VMs.

Get started by visiting `http://portal.azure.com` in your browser and signing in.  Once you're logged in, run the following commands on your lappy:
```Shell
$ brew install azure-cli
$ azure login
$ azure config mode arm
```
Follow the prompts to authenticate your host via a web browser.

You should set a default subscription ID in your Azure CLI environment to ensure that billing is handled the correct way.  Try the following command and look for `Microsoft Azure Sponsorship` in the `Name` field--that should be our sponsored Azure subscription, which is the one we should use for all things Azure:
```
$ azure account list
info:    Executing command account list
data:    Name                         Id                                    Current  State
data:    ---------------------------  ------------------------------------  -------  -------
data:    Microsoft Azure Sponsorship  xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  true     Enabled
info:    account list command OK
```
The `Id` field should contain a UUID (omitted here).  If you can't see the `Microsoft Azure Sponsorship` subscription here, go to the Azure portal and access the `Subscriptions` panel.  The `Subscription Id` field should have the UUID you need.  Once you've got it, paste it into this command:
```
$ azure account set <subscription UUID>
```

Each of script contains documentation regarding its usage.

## SSH Configuration

Update your `.ssh/config` from one of the 20n machines. This would allow you the directly connect to the azure machines by name.

### Naming conventions

With the exception of `twentyn-` hosts, I've adopted the convention of
suffixing each host's names with a region identifier for easier ssh
connectivity through a bastion.  I've selected shortened region names
as the suffixes (i.e. `west2` for `west-us-2` and `scus` for the
incredibly verbose `south-central-us`).  The ssh configuration can
pattern-match on the host names and select the appropriate tunneling
command.  This is a commonly used convention, though it's usually done
with separating the name and region/subnet rather than dashes; alas,
azure does not allow the use of dots in hostnames when using their
internal DNS.

## Web browser proxy configuration

Connecting to azure via ssh is made easy with ssh config files, but
doing the same with a browser is slightly more complicated.  We would
like to be able to transparently connect to any host in a particular
Azure region without having to create a new ssh tunnel for every host
and port.  Fortunately, we can open an ssh tunnel that points at a
remote HTTP proxy process, which can perform DNS lookups and traffic
proxying on the *remote* side of a tunnel.  We can convince our
browser to direct traffic through this tunnel by installing a
proxy-autoconfig file on our local machines.

On OS X, navigate to `System Preferences -> Network -> Advanced -> Proxies`,
check the box next to "Automatic Proxy Configuration," and input a URL
(i.e. an absolute path beginning with `file:///`) to the `proxy.pac`
file in this repository.  Once you click `OK` and `Apply`, your
browser will attempt to pattern match host names against the same
naming conventions used for ssh connectivity, and will direct traffic
to a known port as appropriate.  Now all we need is a tunnel!

**Important**: Once you've set your proxy configuration to use
`proxy.pac`, *don't move/rename/delete that file!* Your machine will
rely on the absolute path of `proxy.pac` being stable and the file
being consistently available in order to enforce correct proxying
rules.

As specified in the `proxy.pac` file, your browser will use certain
ports to attempt to proxy traffic into Azure.  You can set up tunnels
to each region like so (assuming you have acces to our private DNS
server, such as when you are in the office or connected to the VPN):
```
# Open a tunnel to central-us, for connecting to twentyn-* hosts
$ ssh -L 20141:127.0.0.1:3128 azure-central-us
# Open a tunnel to west-us-2 hosts, for connecting to Spark
$ ssh -L 20142:127.0.0.1:3128 azure-west-us-2
# Open a tunnel to south-central-us hosts, for connecting to a
# GPU-enabled host
$ ssh -L 20143:127.0.0.1:3128 azure-south-central-us
# Wiki hosts
$ ssh -L 20144:127.0.0.1:3128 azure-wiki-west-us-2
```

If it becomes convenient to do so, we can use `autossh` to establish
and maintain these connections persistently in the background.

## Basic VM organization

Azure VMs are organized into resource groups, which are arbitrary
collections of machines.  We currently use only three resource groups:
```
twentyn-azure-central-us
twentyn-azure-west-us-2
twentyn-azure-south-central-us
```

Each resource group is confined to a location; the
`twentyn-azure-central-us` group lives in `centralus`.  Locations
determine the cost of VM time, as well as the size of the pool of
available hardware resources.

To see the set of available locations, run
```
$ azure location list
```

To see what VM sizes are available within a region and what our
resource quotas are for that region, run:
```
$ azure vm sizes --location centralus
$ azure quotas show centralus
```

Note that quotas are per region and can be increased (assuming
resources are available) within ~24 hours by contacting Azure support
through the web panel.

Currently, we use `central-us` for "bursty" allocations, where some
tens of hosts must be spun up at a time to run simple command line
utilities.  There is no regional cost savings for `central-us`, so we
use it for short-lived (on the order of hours or days) computations
only.

The `west-us-2` region offers lower prices than other regions, and so
is a good place for longer-running hosts like Spark clusters.  Hosts
in `west-us-2` should still be deallocated when not in use, but the
cost savings between this region and others is material.

`south-central-us` is the only US region that has GPU-enabled VMs.
Our quota in this region has not been raised above the default, so we
can at most have one very powerful GPU-enabled host in `south-central-us`.

## Starting and stopping existing VMs

Azure VMs have a number of operational states representing different
levels of activity and different overheads in preparing the VM for
service:

State | Description | Availability | Billed for time
--- | --- | --- | ---
Running | Host is operating | Immediate | Yes
Stopped | Host is shutdown at the software layer | After boot cycle (somewhat fast) | Yes
Deallocated | Host has been shutdown and its resources returned to the pool | After allocation and boot (very slow) | No

The Azure CLI tools can be used to report and set these states:
```
$ azure vm list
$ azure vm start twentyn-azure-central-us twentyn-worker-2
$ azure vm stop twentyn-azure-central-us twentyn-worker-2
$ azure vm deallocate twentyn-azure-central-us twentyn-worker-2
```

**Important**: Stopping or deallocating a VM will wipe its ephemeral
drive, which lives at `/mnt`.  *Data lost on an ephemeral drive is
absolutely non-recoverable.* Use `/mnt` only for genuinely temporary
data (like Spark work dirs).  Additional disks can be created and
attached if the instance's default storage capacity is insufficient.

The boot disk for a host, however, will survive so long as the VM is
not deleted.  (We may be charged for that storage, but the boot disks
are only a few GB so the cost will be small.)  When a host is not in
use, it should be deallocated to halt billing; starting the host will
attempt to acquire the necessary resources and start the machine.

## Resizing an existing VM

Assuming capacity is available and quotas are not exceeded, a VM can
be resized, giving it more or less CPU and memory capacity as needed.

**Important**: A VM must be stopped before it can be resized.
Resizing a running host will cause it to stop, erasing all data on
`/mnt`.

The Azure CLI tools can be used to resize a VM:
```
azure vm show twentyn-azure-central-us twentyn-worker-2
azure vm stop twentyn-azure-central-us twentyn-worker-2
azure vm set -g twentyn-azure-central-us --vm-size Standard_DS12_v2 -n twentyn-worker-2
azure vm start twentyn-azure-central-us twentyn-worker-2
```

Note that these commands explicitly stop and then start the VM being
resized to make it clear what the `set` command will do implicitly.
It also seems to be slightly faster to run the commands separately
(particularly if they are to be run on many machines in parallel), but
YMMV.

## Creating and Setting Up VMs

Use the `spawn_vm` command to create instances from existing machine templates.  You will need to have logged in via the Azure CLI; follow the instructions in the preliminary documentation in `spawn_vm`.
```
$ ./spawn_vm reachables_wiki twentyn-azure-west-us-2 act-1-wiki-west2
```
Hosts will be created with sensible configurations, and can be accessed via `ssh` once provisioning is complete.

### Host Templates ###

The subdirectories that contain `template.json` and `parameters.json` files represent classes of VMs that can be instantiated repeatedly.  These files should not need to be edited manually--the `spawn_vm` command takes care of all the required parameter updates.  (The parameters with values like `"INSERT ??? HERE"` are there to cause failures if they are not correctly substituted.)  The `generate_uuid` file lists parameters that need to have UUIDs generated an added prior to instance creation.

One exception to this rule is the `location` field.  The VM classes are currently tied to specific Azure locations.  These can be changed by updating the value of the `location` parameter.  In general this should not be necessary, but may be useful should you need to relocate a server.  The value of the `location` field must match the specified resource group; each resource group name indicates its location.

## Connecting to Azure VMs

Once the ssh and HTTP proxy auto config setup explained above is complete, you should be able to connect to hosts as if you were in the same network:
```
$ ssh twentyn-worker-2
```
Open an ssh tunnel like this:
```
$ ssh -L 20141:127.0.0.1:3128 azure-central-us
```
And navigate to `http://twentyn-worker-2` in your web browser to access web services on the remote host.

To do the same for another zone:
```
$ ssh act-1-wiki-west-2
$ ssh -L 20144:127.0.0.1:3128 azure-wiki-west-us-2
# In a separate terminal (on your lappy), do a quick check that the tunnel and HTTP proxy are working correctly.
$ $ curl -vvv -x http://localhost:20144 http://act-1-wiki-west2/index.php?title=Main_Page
# Make sure you get an HTTP 200 in the response.  If so, you're good to go.

# Now navigate to http://act-1-wiki-west2/index.php?title=Main_Page in your web browser.
```
