20n STYLE GUIDE
===============
http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/naming-conventions.html

Notes:
1] package com.c20n.act.* — the extra “c” is so that scala does not complain about numeral start
2] 2 space, expand tab 


BUILD SETUP: SBT
================

Follow manual install instructions on http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html 

Use port or home-brew on mac. Manual setup for unix.

(if port needs to update: do “sudo port selfupdate”; and if that fails “sudo xcode-select —install” and agree to “sudo xcodebuild -license”)
